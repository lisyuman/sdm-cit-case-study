# Case 1 Methodology Summary

## Overview
This document explains the step-by-step methodology for forecasting Superman Plus initial 15-week demand, leveraging historical data and analytical adjustments.

## Business Context
- New Plus series product launching in Sep Wk3.
- Enhanced battery technology compared to previous models.
- Estimated retail price: $205.
- Historical sales data available from Princess Plus ($200) and Dwarf Plus ($120).

---
## Forecasting Methodology

## 🚀 Step 1: Define Baseline
- Used **Princess Plus** 15-week sales data as baseline reference.
- Time-shifted to align with Superman Plus' Sep Wk3 launch.

---

## 🚀 Step 2: Price Elasticity Analysis
- PE Ratio calculated for each region:

    \[
    PE = \frac{\text{Demand Change \% (Princess vs Dwarf)}}{\text{Price Change \% (Princess vs Dwarf)}}
    \]

- Applied PE ratios:
    - AMR ≈ -0.49
    - Europe ≈ -0.24
    - PAC ≈ +0.01

---

## 🚀 Step 3: Price Adjustment
- Superman Plus price: $205
- +2.5% price increase from Princess Plus.
- Applied region-specific adjustment multipliers based on PE.

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Seasonality Adjustment

Identified special weeks based on historical sales spikes/drops:

| Region | Week | Adjustment |
|:---|:---|:---|
| AMR | Nov Wk4 (Thanksgiving) | +20% |
| AMR | Dec Wk4 (New Year) | +16.9% |
| AMR | Oct Wk1 (Launch Exhaustion) | -26.9% |
| Europe | Nov Wk4 (Holiday Season) | +16.1% |
| Europe | Oct Wk1 (Launch Exhaustion) | -36.8% |
| PAC | Nov Wk1 (Singles Day) | +34.6% |
| PAC | Jan Wk3 (Chinese New Year) | +36.2% |
| PAC | Oct Wk1 (Launch Exhaustion) | -22.2% |

Baseline sales were calculated using 2 weeks before + 2 weeks after the special week.

Launch Seasonality Uplift
- First 5 weeks post-launch assumed +10% demand uplift to model typical new product excitement phase.

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Forecast Generation
- Computed final regional forecast:
  - Base sales × Seasonality uplift × PE multiplier
- Applied light smoothing to maintain realistic forecast curves.

---

## 🚀 Step 6: New Technology Sensitivity

- PAC showed slight organic demand lift when Princess Plus introduced tech upgrade (+3.49%).
- Conservatively applied a +3% technology uplift **only for PAC region** in one forecast version.

---

## 🚀 Step 7: Forecast Output

- Two 15-week forecasts generated by region (AMR, Europe, PAC):
  - With PAC tech sensitivity uplift (+3%)
  - Without PAC tech sensitivity uplift
- Outputs saved to `.csv` files.

---

## 🧠 Key Assumptions

- No major channel expansion assumed.
- Macro-economic environment assumed stable.
- All seasonality adjustments based only on raw historical sales.

---

## 🛡️ Engineering Excellence
- Full traceability: raw inputs to final forecast
- Python OOP Script
- Visualized inputs/outputs
- GitHub-structured delivery for transparency

---

## ✨ Non-Technical Insights
- PAC shows resilience to price increases and new tech — growth focus area.
- AMR is price-sensitive — requires closer post-launch monitoring.
- Early seasonality-driven demand surge must be captured in supply planning.

---

## 📋 Conclusion
- Comprehensive, data-driven forecast model.
- Ready for execution with built-in flexibility for real-world variations.
