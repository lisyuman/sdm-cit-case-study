# Case 2 Methodology Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed step-by-step methodology for solving Case 2 of the Superman Plus Material A allocation challenge, based on the final refined script.

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Calculate Available Material A
- Cumulative Material A supply at Jan Wk4 = **320 units**
- Cumulative actual build consumption up to Jan Wk1:
  - Superman: 70 units
  - Superman Plus: 70 units
  - Superman Mini: 60 units
- Total build consumption = 200 units

**Available Material = 320 - 200 = 120 units**

---

## 🚀 Step 2: Protect PAC Reseller Demand
- PAC Reseller cumulative demand at Jan Wk4 = **35 units**
- Sales team mandates full protection of this demand due to promotional activities.

**Remaining Material after PAC Protection = 120 - 35 = 85 units**

---

## 🚀 Step 3: Establish Priority Order
| Priority | Program        | Description           |
|:--------:|:---------------|:----------------------|
| 1        | Superman        | Highest priority      |
| 2        | Superman Mini   | Secondary priority    |
| 3        | Superman Plus   | No allocation (except PAC)

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Confirm Demand Quantities
- Superman cumulative demand at Jan Wk4 = **110 units**
- Superman Mini cumulative demand at Jan Wk4 = **70 units**

**Total priority program demand = 110 + 70 = 180 units**

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Calculate Proportional Allocation
Available 85 units are allocated proportionally based on demand size:

| Program        | Demand Ratio | Calculation                  |
|:---------------|:------------:|:-----------------------------|
| Superman       | 61.11%        | \( \frac{110}{180} \approx 61.11\% \)
| Superman Mini  | 38.89%        | \( \frac{70}{180} \approx 38.89\% \)

---

## 🚀 Step 6: Allocate (Ceiling Rounding)
Applying ceiling rounding to avoid fractional units:

- Superman allocation:
  \( 85 \times 61.11\% \approx 52 \) units
- Superman Mini allocation:
  \( 85 \times 38.89\% \approx 33 \) units

**Final allocated units: 52 + 33 = 85 units**

---

## 🚀 Step 7: Superman Plus Channel Allocation
Since all material was exhausted protecting PAC Reseller and fulfilling Superman and Superman Mini, other Superman Plus channels receive zero allocation:

| Channel                  | Allocated Units |
|:-------------------------|:---------------:|
| Online Store             | 0               |
| Retail Store             | 0               |
| Reseller AMR             | 0               |
| Reseller Europe          | 0               |
| PAC Reseller (Protected) | 35              |

---

## 📈 Final Allocation Summary
| Program/Channel            | Final Allocated Units |
|:----------------------------|:---------------------:|
| PAC Reseller (Superman Plus) | 35                    |
| Superman                    | 52                    |
| Superman Mini                | 33                    |
| Superman Plus - Online Store | 0                     |
| Superman Plus - Retail Store | 0                     |
| Superman Plus - Reseller AMR  | 0                     |
| Superman Plus - Reseller Europe | 0                  |

## ⚠️ Step 8: Shortage Analysis
| Program/Channel            | Shortage? | Details                        |
|:----------------------------|:---------:|:------------------------------|
| Superman                    | Yes       | Demand 110 units, allocated 52 units (short 58 units) |
| Superman Mini               | Yes       | Demand 70 units, allocated 33 units (short 37 units) |
| Superman Plus (Other Channels) | Yes   | Completely unallocated except PAC |

---

## 🛡️ Step 9: Next Steps - Shortage Management
| Action                   | Description                                              |
|:-------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Pull-In Material       | Expedite additional Material A supply from vendors       |
| 2. Rescheduling Build Plan | Prioritize Superman and Mini builds in production lines  |
| 3. Communication with Sales | Inform Sales to adjust customer/promotional expectations |
| 4. Demand Re-Prioritization | Strategically reduce low-priority demand if necessary    |
| 5. Alternative Sourcing    | Activate second-source suppliers                        |
| 6. Risk Assessment Report | Submit impact analysis to leadership for quick decisions |

# ✨ Professional Summary
> In a constrained supply situation, ensure PAC Reseller promotional fulfillment first, proportionally allocate the remainder to critical programs (Superman/Mini), and proactively develop shortage mitigation plans to minimize business disruption.
